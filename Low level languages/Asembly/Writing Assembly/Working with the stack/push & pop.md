The stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) memory structure, and this means the last value pushed is the first value popped.

On x86, the `pop` instruction will take the value from the top of the stack and put it into a register.

Similarly, the `push` instruction will take the value in a register and push it onto the top of the stack.
